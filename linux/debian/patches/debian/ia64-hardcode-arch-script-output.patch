Subject: Hardcode arch script output
Date: Mon, 26 Mar 2007 16:30:51 -0600
Bug-Debian: https://bugs.debian.org/392592
Forwarded: not-needed

Here's a patch that simply uses hardcoded definitions instead of
doing the dynamic tests that require architecture-specific scripts.

I don't particularly like this approach because it restricts
portability and diverts from upstream. But, it is simpler, and this
really needs to be fixed somehow before etch (along with a rebuild of
linux-modules-extra-2.6), so I'm willing to live with it if my other
patch is deemed unacceptable.

My primary concern is that, in the future, the output of these scripts
will change and we (or our successors) will either not notice or
forget to update the hardcoded values.

Including the scripts in linux-kbuild will avoid this manual step
altogether, and allow for the possibility of other archs to provide
their own scripts in the future.
