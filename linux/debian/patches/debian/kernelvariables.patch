Subject: kbuild: Make the toolchain variables easily overwritable
Date: Sun, 22 Feb 2009 15:39:35 +0100
Forwarded: not-needed

Allow make variables to be overridden for each flavour by a file in
the build tree, .kernelvariables.

We currently use this for ARCH, KERNELRELEASE, CC, and in some cases
also CROSS_COMPILE, CFLAGS_KERNEL and CFLAGS_MODULE.

This file can only be read after we establish the build tree, and all
use of $(ARCH) needs to be moved after this.
