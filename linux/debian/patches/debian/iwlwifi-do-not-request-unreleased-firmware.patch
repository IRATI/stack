Subject: iwlwifi: Do not request unreleased firmware for IWL6000
Bug-Debian: https://bugs.debian.org/689416
Forwarded: not-needed

The iwlwifi driver currently supports firmware API versions 4-6 for
these devices.  It will request the file for the latest supported
version and then fall back to earlier versions.  However, the latest
version that has actually been released is 4, so we expect the
requests for versions 6 and then 5 to fail.

The installer appears to report any failed request, and it is probably
not easy to detect that this particular failure is harmless.  So stop
requesting the unreleased firmware.
