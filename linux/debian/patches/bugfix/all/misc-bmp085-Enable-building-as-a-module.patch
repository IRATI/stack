Subject: misc/bmp085: Enable building as a module
Forwarded: http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1514281

Commit 985087dbcb02 'misc: add support for bmp18x chips to the bmp085
driver' changed the BMP085 config symbol to a boolean.  I see no
reason why the shared code cannot be built as a module, so change it
back to tristate.
