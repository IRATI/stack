Subject: sched: ttwu: Return success when only changing the saved_state value

When a task blocks on a rt lock, it saves the current state in
p->saved_state, so a lock related wake up will not destroy the
original state.

When a real wakeup happens, while the task is running due to a lock
wakeup already, we update p->saved_state to TASK_RUNNING, but we do
not return success, which might cause another wakeup in the waitqueue
code and the task remains in the waitqueue list. Return success in
that case as well.
