"This kernel package will build an \"initramfs\" file (/boot/initrd.img-"
"@abiname@@localversion@) for the system's boot loader to use in addition to "
"the kernel itself. This method, formerly unsupported on MIPS, enables a more "
"flexible boot process, and future kernel versions may require a "
"corresponding initrd.img to boot."

msgid ""
"The currently running kernel was booted without an initramfs. You should "
"reconfigure the boot loader to load the initramfs for Linux version "
"@abiname@, and for each later version. This is probably most easily "
"accomplished by using the initrd.img symbolic link maintained by the kernel "
"package."
