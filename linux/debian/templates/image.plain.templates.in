Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Abort installation after depmod error?
 The 'depmod' command exited with the exit code ${exit_value}
 (${SIGNAL}${CORE}).
 .
 Since this image uses initrd, the ${modules_base}/@abiname@@localversion@/modules.dep file
 will not be deleted, even though it may be invalid.
 .
 You should abort the installation and fix the
 errors in depmod, or regenerate the initrd image with a known good
 modules.dep file. If you don't abort the installation, there is
 a danger that the system will fail to boot.

Template: linux-image-@abiname@@localversion@/prerm/removing-running-kernel-@abiname@@localversion@
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Abort kernel removal?
 You are running a kernel (version ${running}) and attempting to remove
 the same version.
 .
 This can make the system unbootable as it will remove
 /boot/vmlinuz-${running} and all modules under the directory
 /lib/modules/${running}. This can only be fixed with a copy of the
 kernel image and the corresponding modules.
 .
 It is highly recommended to abort the kernel removal unless you are
 prepared to fix the system after removal.

Template: linux-image-@abiname@@localversion@/postinst/mips-initrd-@abiname@@localversion@
Type: note
_Description: Boot loader configuration must be updated to load initramfs
 This kernel package will build an "initramfs" file
 (/boot/initrd.img-@abiname@@localversion@) for the system's boot loader
 to use in addition to the kernel itself. This method, formerly
 unsupported on MIPS, enables a more flexible boot process, and future
 kernel versions may require a corresponding initrd.img to boot.
 .
 The currently running kernel was booted without an initramfs. You
 should reconfigure the boot loader to load the initramfs for Linux
 version @abiname@, and for each later version. This is probably
 most easily accomplished by using the initrd.img symbolic link
 maintained by the kernel package.
