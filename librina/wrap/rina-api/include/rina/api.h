 * Each application name is specified using a C string, where the nameâ€™s

 * Application Entity Name and Applicatiion Entity Instance) are separated
 * by the | separator (pipe). The separator can be omitted if it is only
 * used to separate empty strings or a non-empty string from an empty
 * string. Valid strings are for instance "aa|bb|cc|dd", "aa|bb||",
 * "aa|bb", "aa".
