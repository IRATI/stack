{"name":"IRATI","tagline":"RINA implementation for OS/Linux","body":"![dd](https://github.com/IRATI/stack/wiki/images/irati-logo2.png)\r\n\r\nThe Recursive InterNetwork Architecture (RINA) is a new Internetwork architecture whose fundamental principle is that networking is only inter-process communication (IPC). RINA reconstructs the overall structure of the Internet, forming a model that comprises a single repeating layer, the DIF (Distributed IPC Facility), which is the minimal set of components required to allow distributed IPC between application processes. RINA supports inherently and without the need of extra mechanisms mobility, multi-homing and Quality of Service, provides a secure and configurable environment, motivates for a more competitive marketplace and allows for a seamless adoption.\r\n\r\n### Information\r\n\r\nIRATI is an open source implementation of the [RINA architecture](http://irati.eu/education) for OS/Linux systems. An overview of the goals and the high-level design of the IRATI RINA implementation can be found in this [paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6786609).\r\n\r\n* The project's [wiki pages](https://github.com/IRATI/stack/wiki) provide information on using the IRATI stack and understanding its design.\r\n* We host our code here: https://github.com/IRATI/stack\r\n* A public ML is available here: http://www.freelists.org/list/irati\r\n* As well as an IRC channel on the freenode network: #irati\r\n\r\n### Contributors\r\n\r\nThis source code was developed by members of the [IRATI project](www.irati.eu), funded by\r\nthe European commission under the 7th Framework Programme grant number 317814. \r\n\r\nThe contributing members of the project are (alphabetical order):\r\n\r\n* Addy Bombeke (@PaddyWan)             - Ghent University/iMinds, BE\r\n* Bernat Gaston (@bernatgaston)        - Fundacio i2CAT, ES\r\n* Dimitri Staessens (@dstaesse)        - Ghent University/iMinds, BE\r\n* Douwe De Bock (@douwedb26)           - Ghent University/iMinds, BE\r\n* Eduard Grasa (@edugrasa)             - Fundacio i2CAT, ES\r\n* Francesco Salvestrini (@salvestrini) - Nextworks s.r.l., IT\r\n* Leonardo Bergesio (@lbergesio)       - Fundacio i2CAT, ES\r\n* Miquel Tarzan (@miqueltarzan)        - Fundacio i2CAT, ES\r\n* Sander Vrijders (@sandervrijders)    - Ghent University/iMinds, BE\r\n* Vincenzo Maffione (@vmaffione)       - Nextworks s.r.l., IT","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
